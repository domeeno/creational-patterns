# creational-patterns
## The creational design pattern is about efficiently and purposeful design choices of how we create instances of classes at runtime.

Implemented patterns:

* Singleton
* Builder
* Prototype

###### **Singleton** design pattern is useful when we want to be sure we do have only one instance of that class at runtime.
###### **Builder** helps us to deal with flexible objects and simplifies their shaping at runtime.
###### **Prototype** is useful when creation of a new instance of a class is costly, using a cloning technique to which can be more efficient when used in the right circumstances and can save a lot of resources.
